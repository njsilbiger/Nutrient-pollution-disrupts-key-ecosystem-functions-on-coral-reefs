SampleID ,Sample Identifier
InitialWW ,Initial Wet Weight (g) of Gracilaria salicornia; weighed after drying in salad spinner
FinalWW ,Final Wet Weight (g) of Gracilaria salicornia; weighted after drying in salad spinner
BitsWW ,Final Wet Weight (g) of bits of algae that fell out of the individual mesh container but remained in the experimental aquarium; the bits are not included in the mass change calculations because they cannot be associated with individual samples in Expt-1; they are included in the ecosystem metabolism calculations at the aquarium scale
TrayNum1 ,Tray Number associated with the algae sample
TrayNumBits ,Tray Number associated with the algae bits
DeltaWW ,DeltaWW = FinalWW - InitialWW; change in wet weight (g) over the 6 week experiment
pcDeltaWW ,pcDeltaWW = DeltaWW/InitialWW; percent change in wet weight over 6 week experiment
Nuts ,Nutrient level assigned to the aquarium: Ambient/Medium/High
Tank ,Tank Identifier; each aquarium was assigned to one of 3 tanks
Aq_Ex1 ,Aquarium Identifier for Experiment 1; nine aquaria held coral nubbins in expt 1
Aq_Ex2 ,Aquarium Identifier for Experiment 2; all aquaria had coral nubbins in expt 2
TrayWt ,Tray Weight (g) associated with the sample
DW ,Dry Weight (g) of algal sample after drying at 60C for >48 hours
AW ,Ash Weight (g) of algal sample after combusting at 550C for 4 hours
AFDW ,AFDW = DW - AW; Weight (g) of organic matter lost on combustion
pcAFDW ,Percent Ash Free Dry Weight = AFDW/DW; this is the percent of the total dry weight that is organic matter
TrayWtBits ,Tray Weight Associated with algae bits
DWbits ,Dry Weight (g) of algae bits after drying at 60C for >48 hours
AWbits ,Ash Weights (g) of algal bits after combusting at 550C for 4 hours
AFDWbits ,AFDWbits = DWbits - AWbits; Weight (g) of organic matter lost on combustion
pcAFDWbits ,AFDW/DW; percent ash free dry weight for algae bits
FinalVol ,"Final Volume (cm3) of algae based on regression of volume vs wet weight of 6 samples, Rsq = 0.998"
BitsVol ,Final Volume (cm3) of algal bits based on regression of volume vs wet weight
FinalSA ,"Final Surface Area (cm2) of algae based on volume, average diameter of Gracilaria salicornia (2.31 mm +/- .087mm se, n=11), and the assumption that Graciliaria salicornia is made up of cylinders"
BitsSA ,Final Surface Area (cm2) of algae bits
