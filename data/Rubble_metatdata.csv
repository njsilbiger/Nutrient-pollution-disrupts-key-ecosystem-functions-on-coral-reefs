SampleID,Sample Identifier
InitialTemp,Temperature during initial buoyant weight
FinalTemp,Temperature during final buoyant weight
Volume,Volume (cm3) based on displacement to nearest 5 cm3
TrayNum,Tray Number associated with this sample
deltaSAWt,Change in weight before and after wax dipping (g)
InitBW,Initial Dry Weight (g) based on buoyant wt; calculated from the inital buoyant weight and temperature based on Davies (1989) and a coral density of 2.93 g/cm3
FinalBW,Final Dry Weight (g) based on buoyant wt; calculated from the final buoyant weight and temperature based on Davies (1989) and a coral density of 2.93 g/cm3
DeltaBW,DeltaBW_all with three outliers removed
DeltaBW_all,DeltaBW = FinalBW - InitialBW (g); change in dry weight during experiment based on wet weight
pcDeltaBW,Percent Change in Dry Weight = DeltaBW/InitBW
TrayWt,Weight (g) of tray associate with the sample
DW,Dry Weight (g) of sample at end of experiment after oven drying at 60C for >48 hours
AW,Ashed Weight (g) of sample at end of experiment after combusting at 550C for 4 hours
AFDW,Ash Free Dry Weight (g) = DW - AW; organic matter lost during combustion
pcAFDW,Percent Ash Free Dry Weight; organic matter as a percent of dry weight
SA,Surface Area of Rubble (cm2) based on wax dipping
Nuts,Nutrient level assigned to the aquarium: Ambient/Medium/High
Tank,Tank Identifier; each aquarium was assigned to one of 3 tanks
Aq_Ex1,Aquarium Identifier for Experiment 1; nine aquaria held coral nubbins in expt 1
Aq_Ex2,Aquarium Identifier for Experiment 2; all aquaria had coral nubbins in expt 2
