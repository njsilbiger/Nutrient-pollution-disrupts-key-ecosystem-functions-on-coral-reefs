SampleID,Sample Identifier
InitialBW,Buoyant Weight of Sand in petri dish at beginning of experiment
InitialTemp,Temperature during initial buoyant weight
PercentOutside,Visual estimate of the percent of sand that spilled out of petri dish
MeasVol,Final Volume of Sand (cm3) measured by displacement; only for 8 samples
DW,Final Dry Wt of Sand (g) after drying at 60C for >48 hours
SA,Surface Area (cm2) of Sand based on area of petri dish; same for all samples
Vol,"Estimated Final volume (cm3) of Sand based on regression between measured volume vs dry weight (n=8,Rsq=0.999)"
AW,Ashed weight (g) of Sand after combustion at 550C for 4 hours
AFDW,Ash Free Dry Weight (g) = DW - AW; weight (g) of organic matter lost on combustion
pcAFDW,Percent Ash Free Dry Weight = AFDW/DW; percent of dry weight that is organic matter
Nuts,Nutrient level assigned to the aquarium: Ambient/Medium/High
Tank,Tank Identifier; each aquarium was assigned to one of 3 tanks
Aq_Ex1,Aquarium Identifier for Experiment 1; nine aquaria held coral nubbins in expt 1
Aq_Ex2,Aquarium Identifier for Experiment 2; all aquaria had coral nubbins in expt 2
