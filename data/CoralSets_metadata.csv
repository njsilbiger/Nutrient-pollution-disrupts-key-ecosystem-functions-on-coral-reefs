SampleID ,Sample Identifier; single identifier for set of 3 Porites nubbins and 3 Montipora nubbins
Species ,Porites compressa or Montipora capitata
InitialBW ,Initial Buoyant Weight (g) of 3 nubbins
InitialTemp ,Temperature (C) at time of initial buoyant weighing
InitialDate ,Date of initial buoyant weighing
FinalBW ,Final Buoyant Weight (g) of 3 nubbins
FinalTemp ,Temperature (C) at time of final buoyant weighing
FinalDate ,Date of final buoyant weighing
InitBWcorr ,Initial Dry Weight of coral set based on buoyant wt; calculated from InitialBW and InitialTemp based on Davies (1989) and a coral density of 2.93 g/cm3
FinalBWcorr ,Final Dry Weight of coral set based on buoyant wt; calculated from FinalBW and FinalTemp based on Davies (1989) and a coral density of 2.93 g/cm3
DeltaBW ,DeltaBW = FinalBWcorr - InitBWcorr; this is the change in dry weight over the 6 wk experiment based on buoyant weights
pcDeltaBW ,pcDeltaBW = DeltaBW/InitBWcorr; this is the percent change in dry weight based on buoyant weight
Volume ,Total volume (cm3) of 3 nubbins based on displacement; from dataframe CoralNubb
SA ,Total surface area (cm2) of 3 nubbins based on displacement; summed from dataframe CoralNubb
AW ,Total ashed weight (g) of 3 nubbins based on displacement; summed from dataframe CoralNubb
DW ,Total dry weight (g) of 3 nubbins based on displacement; summed from dataframe CoralNubb
AFDW ,Total ash-free dry weight (g) of 3 nubbins based on displacement; summed from dataframe CoralNubb
pcAFDW ,AFDW/DW; organic matter as a percent of total dry weight
Nuts ,Nutrient level assigned to the aquarium: Ambient/Medium/High
Tank ,Tank Identifier; each aquarium was assigned to one of 3 tanks
Aq_Ex1 ,Aquarium Identifier for Experiment 1; nine aquaria held coral nubbins in expt 1
Aq_Ex2 ,Aquarium Identifier for Experiment 2; all aquaria had coral nubbins in expt 2
Check ,Flag if measurement appears to be outlier
